# radixsort
radix-sort algorithm implementation code for positive integers only.

This radix-sort algorithm is designed for learning purposes only . in terms of perfomance , it is not the most efficient solution.

it is very easy to understand as it is well commented. 

I recommend learning counting-sort algorithm first before learning the radix-sort algorithm , because radix-sort  uses counting-sort as a subroutine to sort. Radix-sort is easier when you know counting-sort
